## Databricks Asset Bundles: CI/CD for Data Engineering (2026 Ready)

This repository provides a comprehensive, hands-on guide to **Databricks Asset Bundles (DABs)** and their critical role in building, deploying, and managing **CI/CD workflows for data engineering** on Databricks. It is designed for data engineers preparing for **Databricks interviews**, real-world production deployments, and upcoming **Databricks platform upgrades in 2025**.

### What You’ll Learn

* **Databricks CLI Fundamentals**
  Learn how to use the Databricks Command Line Interface (CLI) as the foundation for interacting with Databricks workspaces and managing asset bundles programmatically.

* **Databricks Asset Bundles Development**
  Understand the structure and configuration of Databricks Asset Bundles, including:

  * YAML-based bundle definitions
  * The role of the `.databricks/` folder for transactional state and deployment metadata
  * Best practices for modular, environment-aware bundle design

* **Deployment Strategies (Dev → Prod)**
  Deploy notebooks, workflows, and jobs across multiple environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`) with support for:

  * Validation and configuration checks
  * Deployment summaries and change tracking
  * Environment-specific overrides

* **Databricks Git Folders Integration**
  Integrate Asset Bundles with **Databricks Git Folders (formerly Databricks Repos)** to enable:

  * Version-controlled development using GitHub
  * Collaborative workflows for teams
  * CI/CD alignment with modern Git-based practices

* **Delta Live Tables (DLT) Deployment**
  Deploy and manage **Delta Live Tables pipelines** using asset bundles, including:

  * Configuration-driven DLT deployments
  * Usage of the new **LakeFlow pipeline editor**
  * Production-ready data pipeline orchestration

### Who This Is For
